# [joeburgess.dev](https://joeburgess.dev)

My personal website built with Go, serving as a basic snapshot of what I'm up to. Its pretty lightweight and just shows some GitHub activity. I didn't use a frontend framework, just Go's `html/template` package.

## Features

- üåì Dark/light theme (rose pine)
- üìä GitHub integration showing recent repos/activity
- üå§Ô∏è Weather served by my own [breeze api](https://github.com/josephburgess/breeze)
- üîÑ Data on periodic refresh every 15mins (rather than on refreshing page - keep that traffic down!)
- üì± Responsive

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Blog**: [glogger](https://github.com/josephburgess/glogger) - my lightweight Go blog package
- **Hosting**: Deployed w/ Docker on a very minimal [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) VPS (details in the Terraform setup [here](https://github.com/josephburgess/backstage))

## Development

If for some reason you wanted to run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephburgess/joeburgess.dev.git
cd joeburgess.dev
go run main.go
```

## Weather Widget

I added the widget mainly because I wanted to integrate it with [breeze](https://github.com/josephburgess/breeze), a lightweight API service I've set up for [gust](http://github.com/josephburgess/gust), another small project I'm working on. I am now based back home in London, so that's where it shows the weather for.

For the widget to work running locally you'll need an API key - you can either install gust and use the one-click signup to get a key, or use your own OpenWeatherMap 3.0 key.

## Blog

The site now includes a blog powered by [glogger](https://github.com/josephburgess/glogger), a lightweight blog engine package I built in go. It supports simple markdown content (no database), multiple themes, and simple integration with existing go sites (as long as you use gorilla/mux, for now!).

## Future Plans

I'm quite interested to see if I can find a way (that doesn't suck) to update the weather widget dynamically depending where I am in the world! I also have a few things I want to add to [glogger](https://github.com/josephburgess/glogger) too - you can see the vague roadmap in the project's README.
